        <h2>AUSTRALIAN WINE</h2>
        <p>Australian wine, originating from places such as South Australia and the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria,
            are throughly enjoyed by locals for it's richness and quality.</p>
        <p>However, how renowned is Australian wine in the global wine market? This data visualization attempts to
            understand Australia's wine making skills in the global market and where Australia ranks amongst world's premium winemakers.</p>

        <p>Australia's wine is rated quite highly amongst other countries, ranked 6th in wine quality. This is despite Australia only utilizing 145,000 square metres of it's land to vineyards, which is a very small
            amount of land dedicated to making wine, in comparison to the leading winemakers in the world such as Italy, France, and Spain.</p>

        </script>
        <p>Despite Australia only utilizing a small amount of it's land for vineyards in comparison to other countries, Australia ranked 5th globally
            for total wine exported in 2022 with roughly 644 million hectolitres of wine exported from Australian vineyards.
        </p>
        <div id="area_chart"></div>

        </script>
        <p>
            Overtime, it shows that Australia's contribution to wine exports globally has stayed around the 9% mark, peaking in 2015. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Noticably, Australia's wine exports have decreased in recent years.
        </p>

        <div id="line_top_exports"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript">

            vegaEmbed('#line_top_exports', spec2).then(function (result){}).catch(console.error);
        </script>

        <p>
            Australia ranks strongly in wine exports in comparison to other countries. Hovering between 4th and 5th for Wine export quantity, generally swapping places with Chile.
            Australia firmly holds a position between the leaders, such as France, Italy, and Spain, and the rest of the world.

        <h2>WINE PRODUCED AND WINE EXPORTED</h2>
        
        <div id="line_prod_export"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            var spec2 = "js/line_production_export.vg.json";
            vegaEmbed('#line_prod_export', spec2).then(function (result){}).catch(console.error);

            vegaEmbed('#bar_prod_export', spec2).then(function (result){}).catch(console.error);
        </script>

        <p>
            Most wine produced by Australia has not been exported in recent years. There seems to be a trend of Australia retaining most of it's wine, rather than exporting to the rest of the world.
            While peaking in 2016 in terms of percentage of wine produced that was exported, there has been a wider gap growing, with Australia looking to retain it's wine produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Australia still maintains similar rankings with it's wine making rival, Chile, but has moved down a position when accounting for total wine produced as the US produces more wine, but exports
            only a small amount of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, Australia maintains its position below the top performers, but well above the rest in the middle of the pack when it comes to wine in the global market.
        </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <h2>DOMESTIC WINE SUPPLY VS HAPPINESS</h2>
        <div id="scatter_wine_happiness"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            var spec2 = "js/scatter_wine_happiness.vg.json";
            vegaEmbed('#scatter_wine_happiness', spec2).then(function (result){}).catch(console.error);
        </script>
    
        <p>
            Australia, despite only exporting 33% of it's total wine produced, still has a relatively high happiness rating. 
            Therefore, Australia might not need to push for more of a presence in the global wine market. If the wine is so good, and results in higher happiness, than why not keep it for ourselves.
