            Australia's wine is rated quite highly amongst other countries,
            <span class="blue-text">ranked 6th in wine quality.</span>
            This is despite
            <span class="blue-text">Australia only utilizing 145,000 hectares of its land to vineyards</span>,
            which is a very small amount of land dedicated to making wine, in comparison to

        <p>Despite Australia only utilizing a small amount of it's land for vineyards in comparison to other countries,
            <span class="blue-text">Australia ranked 5th globally</span>
            for total wine exported in 2022 with roughly
            <span class="blue-text">
                644 million hectolitres of wine exported </span>from Australian

        <p>
            Overtime, it shows that Australia's contribution to wine exports globally has stayed <span
                class="blue-text"> around the 9% mark </span>,
            peaking in 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
            Noticably, Australia's wine <span class="blue-text"> exports have decreased in recent years.</span>

        <p>
            Australia ranks strongly in wine exports in comparison to other countries.
            Hovering <span class="blue-text">between 4th and 5th for
                Wine export quantity </span>, generally swapping places with Chile.
            Australia firmly holds a position between the leaders, such as France, Italy, and Spain, and the rest of the
            world.

        </script>

        <p>
            Most wine produced by Australia has not been exported in recent years. There seems to be a trend of
            <span class="blue-text"> Australia retaining most of it's wine</span>, rather than exporting to the rest of
            the world.
            While peaking in 2016 in terms of percentage of wine produced that was exported, there has been a <span
                class="blue-text">wider gap
                growing</span> , with Australia looking to retain it's wine produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Australia still <span class="blue-text"> maintains similar rankings </span>with it's wine making rival,
            Chile, but has moved down a position
            when accounting for total wine produced as the US produces more wine, but exports
            only a small amount of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general,

            <span class="blue-text"> Australia maintains its position below the top performers, but well above the rest
                in the middle
                of the pack </span>when it comes to wine in the global market.

            vegaEmbed('#scatter_wine_happiness', spec2).then(function (result) { }).catch(console.error);
        </script>

        <p>
            Australia, despite only <span class="blue-text"> exporting 33% of it's total wine produced</span>, still has
            a relatively high happiness
            rating.
            Therefore, Australia might not need to push for more of a presence in the global wine market. If the wine is
            so good, and results in higher happiness, than why not keep it for ourselves.
